Database Management Systems


Q1. Database

- is an organized collection of data, such that it can be easily accessed and managed
- main purpose is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and
  managing data
- Eg. MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ScyllaDB, Cassandra


Q2. DBMS

- is software for storing and retrieving user's data while considering appropriate security measures
- consists of a group of program that manipulate the DB

- Characteristics: 
    * provides security and removes redundancy 
    * self describing nature
    * insulation b/w programs and data abstraction
    * support multiple views of the data
    * sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing
    * follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

- Advantages:
    * offers variety of techniques to store & retrieve data
    * uniform administration procedures for data
    * application prog. never exposed to details of data representation & storage
    * offers data integrity and security
    * reduced application development time
    * schedules concurrent access to the data 

- Disadvantages:
    * cost of hardware/ software of DBMS is high
    * training users is required, due to complexity 
    * all data is integrated into a single DB that can be damaged
    * DBMS can't perform sophisticated calculations


Q3. Instance, Schema, Sub schema

- Instance: it is the snapshot of the DB taken at a particular moment
            at the given time, each schema has itw own set of instances

- Schema: its the overall description/ design of the DB specified during the DB design
          it should not be changed frequently

- Sub schema: defined as the subset/ sub-level of schema that has the same properties as the schema
              its an effective schema for the view


Q4. File systems

- file system is a collection of data, user has to write the procedures for managing the DB
- data is distributed in many files, and it may be in different formats
- provides the detail of the data representation and storage of data
- isn't easy to protect a file under the file system 
- file system doesn't have a crash system
- file system can't efficiently store and retrieve data
- concurrent access has many problems
- cheaper to design, simple structure


Q5. DB Languages

- SQL: 
    * Structured Query Level
    * 5 types of commands:
        + Data Definition Language
        + Data Query Language 
        + Data Manipulation Language
        + Data Control Language
        + Transaction Control Language
